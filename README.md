  <h1>Awesome Probabilistic Programming</h1>
  <br /><br /><br />
  <p>
    A <strong>probabilistic programming language (PPL)</strong> is a programming language designed to describe probabilistic models and then perform inference in those models. PPLs are closely related to graphical models and Bayesian networks, but are more expressive and flexible. Probabilistic programming represents an attempt to "[unify] general purpose programming with probabilistic modeling." (Wikipedia)
